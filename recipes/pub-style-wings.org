* Pub Style Chicken Wings

** Ingredients

- 1 lbs of chicken wings
- 2 tbps of flour
- Salt
- Pepper
- Dutch oven or deep fryer
- Neutral frying oil
- Franks redhot sauce

** Instructions

Bring oil to temperature: 350-375 is the sweet spot. Season flour with
salt and pepper. Feel free to add cayenne pepper or paprika for a more
complex flavour. Dust wings and tapping to remove excess flour. Put
wings into the heated oil and cook for 8-10 minutes. Once golden
brown, remove and place on a wire baking rack or on a paper town to
get rid of the excess oil.

If Franks it too hot for you, in a pan add 1 part franks and 3 parts
butter for a mild hot sauce. Medium is equal parts butter and hot
sauce, etc.

For a true pub experience, serve with a pint, nacho chips, celery,
carrots and your choice of blue cheese or ranch.

Happy winging.
